# Parked / future fixes

## (a) Self-host the AR viewer's CDN dependencies
**Status:** parked (not yet done).

**Why:** Same root cause as the upload/compile bug we fixed — `public/ar-viewer.html`
loads `mindar-image-three.prod.js` (which pulls the same ~2.16 MB `controller-*.js` chunk)
and `three.js` from **jsDelivr**. On a fresh device during a jsDelivr blip, a customer
**scanning a frame** could hit the same silent hang (no error, infinite loading).

**Fix when picked up:** self-host the viewer's deps the same way we did for the compiler:
- Download `three@0.132.2/build/three.module.js` (+ any `examples/jsm` addons actually used)
  and `mind-ar@1.2.2/dist/mindar-image-three.prod.js` into `public/vendor/`.
- Reuse the already-vendored `public/vendor/mind-ar/controller-495b585f.js` + `ui-85e81035.js`.
- Update the importmap + the `import` in `ar-viewer.html` to point at the local `/vendor/...`
  paths (keep the static importmap — no dynamic-injection, to preserve iOS Safari support).
- Verify on a real phone scan.

**Impact:** removes the last third-party-CDN dependency from the customer-facing scan flow.

Bugs: ✅ all fixed (2026-07-02)
Bug #1: ✅ Order page now shows a visible red error banner for submission/validation
  failures and scrolls it into view — `app/landing/order/page.tsx`.
Bug #2: ✅ Submitting the order form now scrolls to top when moving to the
  loading/error screen — `app/landing/order/page.tsx` (`handleSubmit`).
Bug #3: ✅ Nav is now auth-aware — shows "My Account" instead of "Sign in" when a
  session exists — `components/site/Nav.tsx`.

Quick Fixes: ✅ done (2026-07-02)
1. ✅ Header logo enlarged (`h-14 sm:h-16` → `h-16 sm:h-20`) — `components/site/Nav.tsx`.

Few enhancements: 05/07/2026 — ✅ all applied (2026-07-05, dev-verified on localhost)

Implementation notes:
- Services are now data-driven from `lib/site-content.ts` (4 categories): Weddings,
  Special Events, Real Estate & Corporates, Custom. Cards/footer/sitemap auto-update.
- Order-type (physical frame vs Digital AR Only) flows via `?kind=digital` →
  checkout metadata.kind → webhook → confirmation email + success page copy.
- Contact now has its own page at `/landing/contact` (nav + all B2B/bespoke CTAs repoint there).

1. ✅ "Birthdays, Kids & Events" → "Special Events" — `lib/site-content.ts`, `ServiceCard.tsx`.

2. ✅ Slug `birthdays` → `special-events`; added "Occasions we cover" chip grid (full
   event list below) with luxury general-terms intro + a 9:16 vertical Mother's Day demo
   video (`/videos/Mothers Day Mobile Video.mp4`) — `[slug]/page.tsx`, `site-content.ts`.

3. ✅ Merged Real Estate + Business → one "Real Estate & Corporates" page (slug
   `real-estate-corporates`). Lists flyers/brochures/business cards ideas, "we supply the
   digital QR — print it your way", + "Contact us & talk to us" CTA. Hero video set to
   `/videos/RealEstate_websiteAssets.mp4` (also covers item 11) — `site-content.ts`.

4. ✅ Added "Custom" category (replaces Business slot). Bespoke "any event, any frame for
   your special moments" copy + contact-us CTA — `site-content.ts`, `ServiceCard.tsx`.

5. ✅ Success page: physical-frame order no longer says "QR emailed" — states the QR comes
   printed on the frame; confirmation email unchanged (already QR-free) — `order/success/page.tsx`.

6. ✅ Audited: all delivery timelines say "2–3 business days" (order page, pricing FAQ,
   checkout, confirmation email, success page). Digital orders say "QR by email".
7. ✅ Contact now a dedicated page `/landing/contact`; nav "Contact" + all B2B/bespoke CTAs
   point there instead of the footer `#contact` anchor — `site-content.ts`, `landing/contact/page.tsx`.
8. ✅ Digital AR Only flow (`?kind=digital`): success page shows "no physical frame will be
   sent — you'll receive your photo with attached QR to print & frame yourself". Detected
   via Stripe session metadata.kind — `order/success/page.tsx`, `checkout/route.ts`, `resend.ts`.

9.The https://www.thegoldenframe.com.au/landing/order should have following details <modify workdings as per market requirements and other luxury websites>

9. ✅ Order page restyled: "AR Personalised Frames / Your photo. Your video. Alive on the
   wall." hero + 3-step "How it works" cards. Errors now show a high-contrast (border-2
   red-500, red-500/20 bg) summary panel that lists each invalid field by name and scrolls
   into view — `landing/order/page.tsx`.
10. ✅ My Orders: removed "View AR" button. QR is now the primary action ("View QR code")
    with a "Download QR" secondary + a helper line explaining scanning the frame needs no
    app. Shows "QR code preparing…" while pending — `components/account/OrderCard.tsx`.
11. ✅ Real Estate hero video set to `/videos/RealEstate_websiteAssets.mp4` (folded into the
    merged Real Estate & Corporates page, item 3) — `site-content.ts`.
Bugs: ✅ fixed (2026-07-05) — Digital AR Only (AR-only) order messaging
1. ✅ Customer confirmation email (digital branch) now states no physical frame is sent, that
   we email the photo with the QR code attached **within 1–2 business days**, and includes
   print-and-frame instructions ("keep the QR visible so it can be scanned") — `lib/resend.ts`.
2. ✅ Success page (digital) mirrors the same: intro + timeline now say the photo + attached QR
   arrive **within 1–2 business days**, ready to print & frame yourself — `app/order/success/page.tsx`.
   Also aligned the digital order page copy/badge (Digital delivery note + "Photo + QR emailed
   in 1–2 business days") — `app/landing/order/page.tsx`.


More improvement: 05/07/2026:

1. ✅ Fixed: Weddings ("Create your wedding frame") & Special Events ("Create your event
   frame") service CTAs (`ctaHref`) pointed to the legacy `/upload` page (unbranded, no
   Stripe). Both now route to the premium `/landing/order` flow (brand fonts/colours +
   Stripe checkout) — `lib/site-content.ts`.
More improvement: 06/07/2026 — ✅ all applied (2026-07-06, build-verified)
2. ✅ Demo page "Ready to create your own?" CTA now routes to `/landing/services`
   (was `/landing/order`) — `app/landing/demo/page.tsx`.
3. ✅ Weddings & Special Events service-page CTAs now route to `/landing/pricing`
   (was `/landing/order`) — `lib/site-content.ts` (`ctaHref` for both services).
4. ✅ Browser tab icon is now the golden-frame logo on every page: regenerated
   `app/favicon.ico` (16/32/48 px) from `app/icon.png`, replacing the default Next.js
   triangle. Head now references `/favicon.ico` + `/icon.png` site-wide (root layout).
5. ✅ Replaced 136 em/en dashes ("—" "–") with a normal "-" across all user-facing copy
   — landing pages, shared UI (`components/site`, `components/account`), `lib/site-content.ts`,
   customer emails (`lib/resend.ts`) and the Stripe checkout descriptions. Box-drawing
   section dividers ("──") left intact.
6. ✅ Contact page: removed the duplicated "Prefer to message us right now?" WhatsApp+Email
   panel (already covered by the channel cards) and replaced it with a proper enquiry form
   (name / email / phone / message + high-contrast validation) that emails the business via
   Resend, reply-to the customer — `components/site/ContactForm.tsx`, `app/api/contact/route.ts`,
   `lib/resend.ts` (`sendContactEnquiry`), `app/landing/contact/page.tsx`.
